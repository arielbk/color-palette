# Color Palette

Currently a proof-of-concept and work-in-progress but functional!

Generate a palette and drag the colour blobs around. Right click on a blob to adjust it's properties.

When you're ready, you can export the palette as JSON for use in your design system. The JSON will include shade 50-800 of your colours (with 500 as the base) that can be easily dropped into your Chakra UI or Material UI theme.
